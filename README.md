# ios-automation

I am looking to get more involved in iOS App Dev as well as testing the app using XCTest and XCUITest.  Here I will be storing Apps I develop through courses/tutorials.  Once the app is developed and added to github(here), I will be adding Unittest(test code) and UI Automation Tests(test from user point of view).
